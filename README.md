- 👋 Hi, my name is Shree (@krishnaShreedhar)
- 👀 I’m interested in using technology to empower our generation to learn, grow, and lead an enriching life. I also want to use the latest tools to spread the sublime message of Bhagavad-gita that is Krishna Consciousness that can elevate our perception for each other and help us lead a harmonious life.
- 🌱 I’m currently applying and simulataneously learning the art of designing and managing large scale AI/ML projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, and Data Science Problems.
